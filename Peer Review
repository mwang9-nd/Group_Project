Need to include units on graph as necessary

Not sure why functions and statistical analyses are separated in two different R files.

Use of folders to seperate similar files was helpful, and would be great if there was conmtinmued use through project finmish.

Final PDF aesthetics very pleasinmg. 

ANOVA and Regression code were better commented compared to statistical analyses files. 

Project Plan PDF is great, but not all proposed projects have been completed. 

Possibly find a wayu to delete " ## Factors found in summary" from kable
