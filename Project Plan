Write a function for LV

Set initial parameters, time step = 0.1

Run simulations

Set plot time vs population size

play with parameters, understand role and limitations of each parameter

Write a function for RM

Set initial parameters, time step = 0.1

Run simulations

Set plot time vs population size

play with parameters, understand role and limitations of each parameter

Split into two groups tackling each function, then push onto Github for collaborators to check.

All analyze and contribute to discussion of role of parameters in each simulation set.
